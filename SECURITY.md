# ClickHouse Security Vulnerability Response Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We're extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the ClickHouse Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by developers and security engineers.

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by ClickHouse security engineer within 5 working days.
As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated.

## Public Disclosure Timing

The ClickHouse maintainers and the bug submitter negotiate a public disclosure date, with protecting ClickHouse users as the top priority. This ensures users have sufficient time and notice to update affected systems. 

It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to 90 days.
